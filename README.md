# Hello, welcome to my portfolio

This website is under construction, and there's still a bunch of things I would like to try out and improve on. View my portfolio website [here](https://punnyhuimin.github.io/portfolio/)

View updates to my design file on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/proto/lynLsTC8oAKPjjmUIIVvlH/Huimin's-portfolio?node-id=81-89&node-type=frame&t=07pEE6yVeq8muNz6-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=0%3A1)

- Note: I'm not a pro Figma user, so everything I'm doing is by trial and error :blush:

## TODO

1. Clean up [accessibility](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oiBKSjOOFE)
2. Sticky navbar on scroll (To show section)
3. Try out `three.js` for animating the background
4. Else, try out [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJaNGa6UJNQ) for a simpler animation
